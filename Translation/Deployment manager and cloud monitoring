#Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Deployment Manager and Cloud Monitoring

#OBJECTIVES:
    In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
        -Create a Deployment Manager deployment.

        -Update a Deployment Manager deployment.

        -View the load on a VM instance using Cloud Monitoring.

Task 1: Sign in to the Google CONSOLE and  Confirm that needed APIs are enabled
Task2:confirm that these APIs are enabled:

        - Cloud Deployment Manager v2 API

        -Cloud Runtime Configuration API

        - cloud Monitoring API

    
Task3:CreateCreate a Deployment Manager deployment
     -click the Open Cloud Shell button (Activate Cloud Shell). Click Continue. 
		     type export MY_ZONE=Results will be =export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
		- download an editable Deployment Manager template: 
		      gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfcoreinfra/mydeploy.yaml mydeploy.yaml
		-In the Cloud Shell, use the sed command to replace the PROJECT_ID placeholder string with your Google Cloud Platform project ID using this command:
             sed -i -e "s/PROJECT_ID/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/" mydeploy.yaml
        -View the mydeploy.yaml file, with your modifications, with this command
           cat mydeploy.yaml =file will look like this:
                  resources:
  - name: my-vm
    type: compute.v1.instance
    properties:
      zone: us-central1-a
      machineType: zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1
      metadata:
        items:
        - key: startup-script
          value: "apt-get update"
      disks:
      - deviceName: boot
        type: PERSISTENT
        boot: true
        autoDelete: true
        initializeParams:
          sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-v20180806
      networkInterfaces:
      - network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/qwiklabs-gcp-dcdf854d278b50cd/global/networks/default
        accessConfigs:
        - name: External NAT
          type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
    -Build a deployment from the template:		  
	   gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-first-depl --config mydeploy.yaml
	 -click Compute Engine > VM instances. You will see that a VM instance called my-vm has been created, as specified by the template. on Custom metadata section. Confirm that the startup script you specified in your Deployment Manager template has been installed.  
Task4:Update a Deployment Manager deployment
     Return to your Cloud Shell prompt
	   nano mydeploy.yaml
	         value: "apt-get update; apt-get install nginx-light -y"
			 save (Ctrl+O ) and exit
		Return to your Cloud Shell prompt. and 	  install startup script
		   gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-first-depl --config mydeploy.yaml
		 -Click on the my-vm VM instance's name to open its VM instance details pane.
Task5: View the Load on a VM using Cloud Monitoring		
         -click Compute Engine > VM instances.

          To open a command prompt on the my-vm instance, click SSH in its row in the VM instances list.
		      dd if=/dev/urandom | gzip -9 >> /dev/null &
		-Create a Monitoring workspace	
                -click on Navigation menu > Monitoring.
                - Settings - click Agent-click Metrics Explorer under the main Cloud Monitoring menu on the far left.-In the Metric pane of Metrics Explorer-select the resource type GCE VM instance and the metric CPU usage-Terminate your workload generator
                -Return to your ssh session on my-vm and enter this command:
                     kill %1
END THE LAB
